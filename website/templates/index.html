			<h4 class="text-center" style="color: white"><strong>Early life</strong></h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="text-center" style="color: white">I was born on 30 April 1966.during my early years we moved a lot
				due to my father's business needs and I effectively lived in Johannesburg, East London, Durban, Cape
				Town and again Johannesburg, all by the time I started High School.</p>
			<p class="text-center" style="color: white">In High School I went to boarding school, namely <a
					href="https://queenscollege.co.za" target="_blank">Queen's College</a> in the Eastern Cape. It is
				there I met some of the best friends anyone could have. After matriculating at the end of 1983, I went
				nd did my national service for two years. Once again, I met great buddies, one of whom is possibly the
				best mate any guy could have and now lives in Canada.</p>
			<p class="text-center" style="color: white">After leaving the army, what to do?</p>
			<p class="text-center" style="color: white">I decided to go to university and study a BCom. I went to the <a
					href="https://www.wits.ac.za/" target="_blank">University of the Witwatersrand (WITS)</a> and
				studied for three years. I was not the best student, but I did pass and get my degree. Thereafter, I
				completed my Honours degree in finance at The university of South Africa (Unisa).</p>
			
			<br/>
			<h4 class="text-center" style="color: white"><strong>Work</strong></h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="text-center" style="color: white">I spent many years working for various companies in the role of
				Financial Manager.</p>
			<p class="text-center" style="color: white">I was never really happy or satisfied but then oneday quite by
				accident I discovered programming (Or Coding). As the financial manager for a group of companies,
				I asked my IT manager to create some reports for me, I was informed it is not possible, I did not
				believe that and as a result taught myself how to code.
				<br/><br>
				That was the start of my journey into the world of coding. I have never looked back and have never
				regretted my decision to change careers. I was fortunate enough to be able to work for a company that
				allowed me to code as my full-time job and I have never looked back.
				<br/><br>
				Having worked for many years as a financial manager, I feel it gives me a slight edge over developers that don’t necessarily grasp the needs of the client.
<br />
I have designed an ERP app for my employer from scratch that does the following:

<br /><br />
<strong>INVESTORS</strong><br />
Load investors with all their details.<br />
Allocated Investors to construction units.<br />
Calculate daily interest earned.<br />
Create loan agreements when new investor comes on board or current investor “rolls over” into new investments.<br />
Investor statements  download / email<br />
Commission calculations for investment consultants<br />
numerous reports in PDF and Excel<br />
<br /><br />
<strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong><br />
Manage subcontractors on the build sites<br />
Manage Quality control questionnaires with subcontractors to evaluate their work.<br />
Subcontractor valuations on work done<br />
Creation of payment advices for subcontractors<br />
numerous reports in PDF and Excel<br />
<br /><br />

<strong>SALES</strong><br />
Monitor sales process through from offer to purchase to final transfer of the property with milestones<br />
Monitor sales people and who sold the unit.<br />
Monitor costs of sales like bond costs / transfer fees etc.<br />
Reports to ascertain final nett profit as well as final settlement to investors invested in the unit.<br />
<br /><br />
<strong>MARKETING (LEAD GENERATION)</strong><br />
Populate the database with leads generated.<br />
This is for investments as well as sales.<br />
Leads from Facebook / Instagram / WhatsApp get forwarded to landing page with a form.<br />
Leads from the investment website populate the database directly.<br />
Leads from the property website as well as from property24 get emailed to an address and emails are scraped and database is populated.<br />
Each sales person gets allocated the leads on a round robin basis, the lead gets an email informing them which sales person will be in contact with them.<br />
Sales people get an email as well as an SMS to facilitate quick fast service.<br />
Leads are visible in the app where sales people fill in action taken, rate the lead etc.<br />
leads are also shown graphically so we can monitor lead source etc.<br />
<br /><br />

I have also created an investor portal where investors can log into the app and view their investments.<br />

The ERP system has roughly 25 regular users (in house staff) and the investor portal has roughly 300 individual investors with investments of roughly R400 million (ZAR)<br />

The front end for all apps are written in VueJS (Vue 3 with composition API), the backends are a mixture of NodeJS and Python. I am currently looking to convert 100% to Python. We use MongoDB as the database (We were on MySQL but converted to mongo due to faster development time)<br /><br />

				<strong>My Aspirations:</strong> To be 100% remote and to be able to work from anywhere in the
				world.

<!--				<strong>Goal Date:</strong> Early 2024-->

				I have since gained a lot of experience in various languages and technologies such as:
